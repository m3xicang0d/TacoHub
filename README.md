# TacoHub
* This plugin was the first one I made with the help of my friend *FxMxGRAGFX*, I put it public for all those people who need a hubcore.
* This is the definitive version that was last seen on mc-market*
* The code was 80% cleaned up, you can still find some simple little bugs.

# Support
* TacoHub supports very well [1.7.10 - 1.16]
