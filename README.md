# TacoHub
* This plugin was the first one I made with the help of my friend *FxMxGRAGFX*, I put it public for all those people who need a hubcore.
* This is the definitive version that was last seen on mc-market*
* The code was 80% cleaned up, you can still find some simple little bugs.


# Support
* TacoHub supports very well [1.7.10 - 1.16]


# APIs used
* Assemble | Scoreboard
* Nosequel | Tablist


# Authors

# Gratitude
* I thank all the buyers that I had in TacoHub that were around (25), and I also thank my friend FxMxGRAGFX for helping me at the beginning and giving me some advice..

* It should be noted that he stopped helping me from version 1.0, the other versions were made by me... so if you see that my code is wrong, I ask you to consider that I don't need Skidd to do things.


# Selling & Using
* You're free to use this product for anything, including selling and running on your own server. However, if you're going to sell a plugin using this, please leave credits and/or a link to the repository.
